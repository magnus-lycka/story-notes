    As scrum master I want to keep _user stories_ in a _text file_,
    so that it's easy to version control and possible to use
    both as is and programatically without tool lock-in.
  acc_crit_list:
    - Use a plain text based standardized format
    - Not XML!

  main_text: >
    As team member I want to see updated _user stories displayed_
    on the scrum board, so that I know what we need to do in the
    sprint.
  acc_crit_list:
    - No need to decipher bad hand-writing
    - A piece of paper which I can move and add notes to.
