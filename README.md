story-notes
===========

A simple tool to get user stories written in a text file into notes that you can put on the wall. Currently depends on Python 2.7, PyYAML, Inkscape and Pritt Glue Roller...

yaml is used as file format for the backlog.

Incscape is used to print the generated .svg files, and was used to create prototypes.

Pritt Roller Glue is used to attach the prints to the board... (It more or less turns them into Post-it notes)

The current version prints four cards on one landscape A4. It makes one .svg per four stories.
